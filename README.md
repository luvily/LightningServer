# LightningServer
Lightweight and simple web service, which is emulating an Optifine's one.

### How to do this
You should add a new entry to file in this location:
- Linux and Mac OS:
  ```text
  /etc/hosts
  ```
- Windows: 
  ```text
  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
  ````
You can now ask what I should add there, this is simple just add line like this below:
```text
127.0.0.1 s.optifine.net
```

_If you still don't know how to do this look [there](./assets/hosts)._

### Wow, is there any screenshot, yes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
